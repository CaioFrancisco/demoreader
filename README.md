# Source Engine Demo Reader/Parser

This is a small project, incentivated by Anomidae's "Interloper" ARG. It is still in an early state and can't do much.

It's planned to parse `.dem` files and print all information it contains in a human-readable form.

It is currently based on [nillerusr's "source-engine" repository](https://github.com/nillerusr/source-engine).
