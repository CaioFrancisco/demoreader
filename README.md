# Source Engine Demo Reader/Parser

Parses `.dem` files into it's header and packets. `main.py` may be used to test if it can read an entire file and `parsing.py` may be imported into a python script to read the demo file in your own code.

It currently cannot parse datatables, but it's a planned feature in the future.

It is currently based on [nillerusr's "source-engine" repository](https://github.com/nillerusr/source-engine).

# Planned features

* Read datatables. (Urgent)

* Write all data into a `.json` file.

* Replace terminal text with GUI.
